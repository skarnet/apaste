<h1> The <tt>apasted</tt> program </h1>

<p>
 <tt>apasted</tt> is the server-side program for the apaste package. It
expects its stdin and stdout to be connected to the network, having being
contacted by an <a href="apastec.html">apastec</a> client. It reads a
series of files transmitted by the client, stores it on the server, and
sends back a <em>slug</em> to the client, i.e. an identifier for the
stored files.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     apasted [ -r <em>rtimeout</em> ] [ -w <em>wtimeout</em> ] [ -d <em>rootdir</em> ] [ -p <em>prefix</em> ] [ -m <em>maxfiles</em> ]
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> apasted reads data on its stdin, expecting the protocol spoken by the
<a href="apastec.html">apastec</a> client, containing one or more files. </li>
 <li> It creates a subdirectory <em>subdir</em> in its working directory,
and stores the files it receives under it.
  <ul>
   <li> If it only receives one file, it stores it in <tt><em>subdir</em>/index.txt</tt>. </li>
   <li> If it receives two or more files, it stores each file <em>file</em> as
<tt><em>subdir</em>/<em>file</em>.txt</tt>, and creates a
<tt><em>subdir</em>/index.html</tt> file with hyperlinks to every file in <em>subdir</em>. </li>
  </ul> </li>
 <li> It sends the <em>subdir</em> name back to the client, as a <em>slug</em>. </li>
 <li> It exits 0 </li>
</ul>

<h2> Exit codes </h2>

<dl>
 <dt> 0 </dt> <dd> Success. </dd>
 <dt> 1 </dt> <dd> Protocol error. The client sent incorrectly formatted data. </dd>
 <dt> 100 </dt> <dd> Bad usage. apasted was run in an incorrect way. </dd>
 <dt> 111 </dt> <dd> System call failed. This usually signals an issue with the
underlying operating system, or with the network in some way. </dt>
</dl>

<h2> Options </h2>

<dl>
 <dt> -r <em>rtimeout</em> </dt>
 <dd> If the client hasn't transmitted all its data within <em>rtimeout</em>
milliseconds, give up. The default is 0, meaning infinite: apasted will
wait forever for client data if necessary. </dd>

 <dt> -w <em>wtimeout</em> </dt>
 <dd> If apasted fails to send the slug to the client within <em>wtimeout</em>
milliseconds, give up. The default is 0, meaning infinite: apasted will
take as much time as it needs to send its answer. </dd>

 <dt> -d <em>rootdir</em> </dt>
 <dd> Switch to <em>rootdir</em> and store files there. The default is
apasted's working directory. </dd>

 <dt> -p <em>prefix</em> </dt>
 <dd> When sending a slug to the client, prefix <em>subdir</em> with <em>prefix</em>,
and append a slash at the end. This is useful when apasted writes its files to
a web server's document hierarchy, which is the intended case. If <em>prefix</em>
is the URL of apasted's base directory, then the slug can directly be used as a
URL to access the client's files. </dd>

 <dt> -m <em>maxfiles</em> </dt>
 <dd> Accept a maximum of <em>maxfiles</em> files at a time from the client.
The default is 0, meaning unlimited: the client can send as many files as it
wants and apasted will still store them if it is possible. </dd>
</dl>

<h2> Typical usage </h2>

<ul>
 <li> apasted is meant to be run under a super-server accepting client connections.
Run it under inetd or
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-tcpserver.html">s6-tcpserver</a>
for plaintext connections, and under
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-tlsserver.html">s6-tlsserver</a>
for TLS-tunneled connections. </li>
 <li> To publish the data received and stored by apasted, the simplest way is
to have a web server running and serving the hierarchy of apasted files. Use the
<tt>-p</tt> option on the apasted command line to make sure the client receives
a full URL to its files. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Caveats </h2>

<ul>
 <li> apaste is a <em>push</em> protocol: the client sends data to be stored on
the server. As such, it is very easy to abuse, and caution should be taken when
running an apasted server:
  <ul>
   <li> If possible, have quotas on the filesystem hosting the apasted storage area </li>
   <li> Use the <tt>-m</tt> option to avoid trivial inode exhaustion attacks </li>
   <li> Use your super-server's options to mitigate client patterns of abuse, log and
block the IPs of problematic clients </li>
   <li> Run scripts that regularly delete old <em>subdir</em>s (and their contents)
in the apasted storage area. </li>
   <li> Be aware, and warn your users, that a pastebin is a service to the community,
and that abusing the service is the best and quickest way to make it go away. </li>
  </ul> </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> apasted will store a file named <em>file</em> as <em>file.txt</em> so that a
web server can always serve it as plain text. apaste is not meant to send binary
files of an arbitrary MIME type. </li>
 <li> A unique file is stored as <tt><em>slug</em>/index.txt</tt>; if apasted is
run with <tt>-p http://example.com/</tt> then the apaste client, on success,
will print <tt>http://example.com/<em>slug</em>/</tt>. Make sure that your web server can
automatically interpret that URL as <tt>http://example.com/<em>slug</em>/index.txt</tt>. </li>
</ul>
