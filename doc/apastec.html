<h1> The <tt>apastec</tt> program </h1>

<p>
 <tt>apastec</tt> is a program that reads one or more files, or its
standard input, and sends them to a preopened file descriptor.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     apastec [ -r <em>rtimeout</em> ] [ -w <em>wtimeout</em> ] <em>file...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> apastec expects to have, in addition to standard file descriptors 0, 1 and 2,
its file descriptors 6 and 7 open and connected to a remote
<a href="apasted.html">apasted</a> server. </li>
 <li> For every <em>file</em> given as argument, it sends the contents of <em>file</em>
over the network. If <em>file</em> is <tt>-</tt> (dash), then stdout is transmitted
until EOF. </li>
 <li> The server answers with a blob of six printable characters, named a <em>slug</em>.
Depending on the server configuration, it may embed the slug in a complete URL, for
easy copy-paste into a browser; or it may embed it in another way. </li>
 <li> apastec prints the slug to its stdout, then exits 0. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Exit codes </h2>

<dl>
 <dt> 0 </dt> <dd> Success. The data has been recorded by the server and available in
some way as indicated by the slug. </dd>
 <dt> 100 </dt> <dd> Bad usage. apaste was run in an incorrect way. </dd>
 <dt> 111 </dt> <dd> System call failed. This usually signals an issue with the
underlying operating system, or with the network in some way. </dt>
</dl>

<h2> Options </h2>

<dl>
 <dt> -r <em>rtimeout</em> </dt>
 <dd> If the server isn't answering with a slug within <em>rtimeout</em>
milliseconds, give up. The default is 0, meaning infinite: apastec will
wait forever for a server reply if necessary. </dd>

 <dt> -w <em>wtimeout</em> </dt>
 <dd> If the server hasn't accepted all the data within <em>wtimeout</em>
milliseconds, give up. The default is 0, meaning infinite: apastec will
take as much time as it needs to send its data. </dd>
</dl>

<h2> Typical usage </h2>

<p>
 apastec isn't meant to be used directly. It is meant to be invoked as
part of a command line crafted by the <a href="apaste.html">apaste</a>
command, where programs from the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/">s6-networking</a> package
establish the connection to the server, then exec into apastec to read
the user's data and transmit them with the apaste protocol.
</p>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-</tt>, i.e. stdin, cannot be mentioned several times as an argument. It
can be transmitted with other files, but cannot be duplicated. </li>
</ul>
